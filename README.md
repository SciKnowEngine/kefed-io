# kefed.io

Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design (KEfED) is a design methodology for experimental data that is based on the idea that it should be possible to develop a generative model for data based on the experimental protocol that created it. This work was originally described in [Russ et al 2011](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-351), where we describe a prototype editing system written in the Flex language (see https://github.com/BMKEG/kefedEditor). Since Flex is now deprecated, that system is now obselete, leading us to now develop `kefed.io`: an ontology-enabled, Javascript tool based on [JGraph's MxGraph](https://github.com/jgraph) software. This is commercial-grade software that has recently been released as open source. It is a graph-drawing web-application that can be repackaged and repurposed to provide an high-quality user interface.
